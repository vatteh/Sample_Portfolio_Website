Sample_Portfolio_Website
========================

Learning to use CSS, Javascript and Jquery animations. 

I'm about 6 weeks in learning front end web languages and I used this website to test what I have learned so far. My focus on creating this sample website was to learn how to display a simple website using HTML and CSS, give it some animations using JavaScript and Jquery, and practicing talking to the server using PHP and Ajax functions.
